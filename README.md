# Zig Pico Project
This project is primarily for developing RPi Pico SDK bindings for Zig. Make sure you have `zig` and the Pico SDK.

## Where build.zig?
Currently the Pico SDK is working on Clang support and Zig is working on a package manager.
It's worth waiting for both of these before making a build.zig package for the pico-sdk. In the meantime; I'll continue working on bindings here.
